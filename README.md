**The ultimate solution for DJs to download and organize music from YouTube with Spotify playlist integration, optimized for Pioneer Rekordbox.**

Transform your Spotify playlists into a fully organized DJ library with automatic KEY detection (Camelot notation), BPM analysis, and quality filtering - perfect for harmonic mixing!

---

## 💡 Why This Project Exists

As a DJ, I faced a critical limitation: **Rekordbox doesn't allow editing tracks from Spotify streaming**. You can't analyze cue points, loops, or hot cues on Spotify tracks - you need local files.

The problem? Manually downloading hundreds of songs from Spotify playlists was tedious and time-consuming.

**The Solution:** I discovered two amazing open-source projects:
- **[spotify-backup](https://github.com/caseychu/spotify-backup)** by [@caseychu](https://github.com/caseychu) - Extract Spotify playlists to JSON
- **[ytm-dlapi](https://github.com/Thanatoslayer6/ytm-dlapi)** - YouTube Music download concept

I combined and enhanced these tools with:
- ✨ **Automatic KEY detection** using Essentia (Camelot notation for harmonic mixing)
- 🥁 **BPM analysis** for perfect beatmatching
- 🎯 **Quality filtering** (removes LIVE versions, UNRELEASED tracks, short clips)
- 📚 **Smart organization** (by genre, artist, or custom folders)
- 🔄 **Batch processing** for hundreds of songs at once

Now you can build a complete Rekordbox library from your Spotify playlists with full editing capabilities!

## 📖 Usage

> **⚠️ Important Note About Repositories:**
>
> This project uses **TWO separate repositories**:
> 1. **This repo** (rekordbox-spotify-downloader) - Main tool for downloading and KEY detection
> 2. **[spotify-backup](https://github.com/caseychu/spotify-backup)** - Third-party tool for extracting Spotify playlists (only needed if you use Option 2)
>
> **If you don't use Spotify playlists**, you only need this repo (Option 1)!

---

### Option 1: Download from a Simple Song List (No Spotify Needed)

**1. Create a text file with song names:**

`songs.txt`:
```
Martin Garrix - Animals
Lost Frequencies - Are You With Me
Avicii - Levels
David Guetta, Bebe Rexha - I'm Good (Blue)
```

**2. Download with KEY and BPM detection:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python3 youtube_to_rekordbox_enhanced.py songs.txt
```

**3. Organize by folder (optional):**
```bash
# Download into HOUSE folder
python3 youtube_to_rekordbox_enhanced.py house_songs.txt 90 HOUSE

# Download into POP folder
python3 youtube_to_rekordbox_enhanced.py pop_songs.txt 90 POP
```

---

### Option 2: Extract from Your Spotify Playlists

**1. Get your Spotify data:**

First, clone the spotify-backup tool (only needs to be done once):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/caseychu/spotify-backup.git
```

Then authenticate with your Spotify account:
```bash
cd spotify-backup
python3 spotify-backup.py youremail@example.com
cd ..
```

This will:
- Open your browser for Spotify OAuth login
- Download all your playlists to a JSON file: `youremail@example_2025_11_13.json`

**2. Extract specific playlists:**

```bash
python3 extract_spotify_playlists.py spotify-backup/youremail@example_2025_11_13.json
```

The script will ask which playlists you want to extract. It creates text files like:
- `spotify_HOUSE.txt`
- `spotify_POP.txt`
- etc.

**3. Download the songs:**
```bash
# Download HOUSE playlist
python3 youtube_to_rekordbox_enhanced.py spotify_HOUSE.txt 90 HOUSE

# Download POP playlist
python3 youtube_to_rekordbox_enhanced.py spotify_POP.txt 90 POP
```

---

### Simple 3-Step Workflow Summary

```bash
# Step 1: Get your Spotify playlists (one-time setup)
git clone https://github.com/caseychu/spotify-backup.git
cd spotify-backup && python3 spotify-backup.py youremail@example.com && cd ..

# Step 2: Extract the playlists you want
python3 extract_spotify_playlists.py spotify-backup/youremail@example_2025_11_13.json

# Step 3: Download with KEY/BPM detection
python3 youtube_to_rekordbox_enhanced.py spotify_HOUSE.txt 90 HOUSE
```

Done! Your music is now in `rekordbox_music/HOUSE/` with KEY (Camelot) and BPM tags.

### 3. Update Metadata for Existing Files

**Update KEY and BPM for all folders:**
```bash
./update_all_metadata.sh
```

**Update specific folder:**
```bash
python update_metadata.py /path/to/your/music/folder
```

## 🎹 Camelot Key Notation

The system uses **Camelot Wheel notation** for harmonic mixing:

| Musical Key | Camelot | Musical Key | Camelot |
|-------------|---------|-------------|---------|
| C major     | 8B      | A minor     | 8A      |
| G major     | 9B      | E minor     | 9A      |
| D major     | 10B     | B minor     | 10A     |
| A major     | 11B     | F# minor    | 11A     |
| E major     | 12B     | C# minor    | 12A     |
| B major     | 1B      | G# minor    | 1A      |
| F# major    | 2B      | D# minor    | 2A      |
| Db major    | 3B      | Bb minor    | 3A      |
| Ab major    | 4B      | F minor     | 4A      |
| Eb major    | 5B      | C minor     | 5A      |
| Bb major    | 6B      | G minor     | 6A      |
| F major     | 7B      | D minor     | 7A      |

**Harmonic Mixing Rules:**
- Mix tracks with the **same number** (e.g., 8A → 8B)
- Mix tracks **±1** on the wheel (e.g., 8A → 9A or 7A)
